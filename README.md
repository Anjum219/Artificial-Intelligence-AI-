aStar.cpp : Implementation of n-puzzle board game.
The n-puzzle is a puzzle invented and popularized by Noyes Palmer Chapman in the 1870s. It is played on a k x k grid with k^2-1 (=n) square blocks labeled 1 through n and a blank square. 
I implemented it using A* (A star) algorithm .To compute distance between two nodes I used three different methods : Hamming distance, Manhattan distance, Conflict resolution.
